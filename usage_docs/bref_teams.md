# Baseball Reference Teams Docs

This module is currently being developed, I'm gonna wait until the module is complete before writing the docs. For currently available functions, please refer to the `bref_teams.py` file in the `pybaseballstats` package. It includes docstrings for each function which should be enough to get you started.
